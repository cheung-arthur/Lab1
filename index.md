##Who am I?
Hi! I'm currently a sophomore studying **computer science**. I'm an international student coming from **Hong Kong**. 
###Experience in Tech
My main focuses right now are on classes, and an internship I'm doing over at **Qualcomm Institute** to create *historic metahumans*(i.e AI NPCs) in Unreal Engine 5, where we work on the whole pipeline from *speech to text*, to *dialogue generation* using LLMs, to *speech synthesis* with emotion labels. It's opened up my perspective on truly how extensive the responsibility developers have when developing AI products, (e.g preventing hallucinations & misinformation, cleaning & training reliable sources of data, etc) - this is my first internship experience and I'm loving the supportive dynamic between my peers.
I've also had some research experience in a **gastroenterology** lab as a **machine learning** research assistant, as I want to explore this field to see whether it's what I want to devote my career to. Thus, I'm familiar with python libraries like `pandas` and `tensorflow`.
